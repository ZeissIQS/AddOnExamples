# AddOnExamples

This repository contains various [ZEISS INSPECT](https://www.zeiss.com/metrology/products/software.html#inspectionsolutions) Add-on examples for educational and inspirational purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Please have a look into the [ZEISS INSPECT add-on documentation](https://zeissiqs.github.io/) for a general introduction to ZEISS INSPECT Add-on development, a set of documented Add-on examples and the API specification.

In principle, a ZEISS INSPECT Add-on is just a zip'ed directory with a special structure, containing script, templates, definitions etc. necessary to add features to the ZEISS Inspect software. The Add-ons listed here can be downloaded in compressed form via the ZEISS Quality Software Store in the [ZEISS Quality Suite](https://www.zeiss.com/metrology/products/software.html). Alternatively, for fiddling around with them, the Add-ons repository can, too, be cloned, zip'ed and then dropped right into ZEISS Inspect. Please see the documentation mentioned above for more details or consult the [training center](https://training.gom.com) for a general feature overview.
